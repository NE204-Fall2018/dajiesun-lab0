If only using the peak of Am-241(59.5409 keV) and the peak of Cs-137 (661.657 keV), an approximation result is got as:
\[{Energy^*}=0.2805446 \cdot Channel\,Number+1.263557\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(2)\]

Compare Equation (1) with Equation (2), it is found they are still very close, especially with respect to the slope.
