# Overall (80/100)
 - As we discussed, want more/smaller commits in future labs.
 - Overall you are very much on the right track... need a little more focus
   and attention to detail in the presentation and interpretation of the
   results.

# Build (6/10)
 - Need to modify README with instructions for how to use your code and build 
   your report!
 - Typically, you want your analysis to be completely automated; i.e. it 
   shouldn't require any clicking from the user to close plots etc. Consider
   having multiple keywords in the `Makefile`, e.g. `make analysis` to 
   generate and save the plots, or `make show` to allow the user to view the
   generated plots interactively.

# Testing (10/10)
 - No tests implemented... consider practicing this for the future!

# Intro / Background / Motivation (15/15)
 - Okay for lab 0, in the future make sure to add much more detail about what
   you are studying and why!

# Methods (15/15)
 - Adequate description of the tasks and approach for lab 0.

# Results and discussion (28/40)
 - Beware of significant figures: you are claiming far too much precision with
   the numbers you are using.
 - Good labels for your figure: may want to include a legend as well.
 - No discussion of uncertainties. What are the uncertainties involved with
   your measurement? How are they manifested?
 - Good idea comparing multiple calibrations, but need a more fleshed-out 
   discussion in terms of how your results relate back to the task at hand.

# Conclusion (6/10)
 - Though you don't need a separate *Conclusion* section, your discussion 
   should include some overall thoughts on the experiment and the scope of your
   results. Bear this in mind for future labs.
